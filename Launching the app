Create K8s deployment

1a. Create nginx-deployment.yaml by running the below code:


cat <<EoF> nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EoF


1b. Create the nginx deployment using kubectl apply command:

kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

1c. Check whether the deployment is created using kubectl get command:

kubectl get deployment


Expose the K8s app to see the details of pod, deployment and service

Let's create a new service and expose an external IP address using the expose command with type as LoadBalancer:


kubectl expose deployment/nginx-deployment --type="LoadBalancer"
